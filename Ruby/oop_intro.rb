# Why Classes?

# Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects. 
# (Almost) everything in Ruby is an object! 
# You've been using them all along, so they should be very familiar. 
# Objects have methods, which you've seen before, and attributes, which are just data. 

#For instance, in
"Matz".length # ==> 4
# the "Matz" object is a string with a .length method and a length attribute of 4. 
# We'll learn how to build our own objects with their own methods and internal variables in the next few exercises.

# But what exactly makes "Matz" a string? The fact that it's an instance of the String class. 
# A class is just a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes and methods.
