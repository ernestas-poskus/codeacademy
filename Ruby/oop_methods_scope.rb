# Method scope

# Public methods are by default

# Private methods are just that: they're private to the object where they are
# defined. This means you can only call these methods from other code inside
# the object. Another way to say this is that the method cannot be called with an explicit receiver. 
# You've been using receivers all alongâ€”these are the objects on which methods are called! Whenever you call object.method, object is the receiver of the method.

# In order to access private information, we have to create public methods that know how to get it. 
# This separates the private implementation from the public interface, and we'll go over this in more detail in the next two exercises.
