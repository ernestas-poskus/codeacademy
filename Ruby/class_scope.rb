# Scope it Out

# Another important aspect of Ruby classes is scope. The scope of a variable is the context in which it's visible to the program.

# It may surprise you to learn that not all variables are accessible to all parts of a Ruby program at all times. 
# When dealing with classes, you can have variables that are available everywhere (global variables), 
# ones that are only available certain methods (local variables), others that are members of a certain class (class variables), 
# and variables that are only available to particular instances of a class (instance variables).

# The same goes for methods: some are available everywhere, some are only available to members of a certain class, 
# and still others are only available to particular instance objects.




# Check out the code in the editor. See how some variables start with $, @, 
# or @@? This helps mark them as global, instance, and class variables (respectively).

class Computer
  $manufacturer = "Mango Computer, Inc."
  @@files = {hello: "Hello, world!"}
  
  def initialize(username, password)
    @username = username
    @password = password
  end
  
  def current_user
    @username
  end

    @@files

# Make a new Computer instance:
hal = Computer.new("Dave", 12345)

puts "Current user: #{hal.current_user}" # @username belongs to the hal instance.

puts "Manufacturer: #{$manufacturer}" # $manufacturer is global! We can get it directly.

puts "Files: #{Computer.display_files}" # @@files belongs to the Computer class.
