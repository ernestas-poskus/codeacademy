# What's a Module?

# You can think of a module as a toolbox that contains a set methods and constants. 
# There are lots and lots of Ruby tools you might want to use, but it would clutter the interpreter to keep them around all the time. 
# For that reason, we keep a bunch of them in modules and only pull in those module toolboxes when we need the constants and methods inside!

# You can think of modules as being very much like classes, only modules can't create instances and can't have subclasses. They're just used to store things!
