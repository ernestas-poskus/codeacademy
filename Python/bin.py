The bin() Function

# There are Python functions that can aid you with bitwise operations. 
# In order to print a number in its binary representation, you can use the bin() function. 
# bin() takes an integer as input and returns the binary representation of that integer in a string. 
# (Keep in mind that after using the bin function, you can no longer operate on the value like a number.)

# You can also represent numbers in base 8 and base 16 using the oct() and hex() functions. 

print bin(1)
print bin(2)
print bin(3)
print bin(4)
print bin(5)
