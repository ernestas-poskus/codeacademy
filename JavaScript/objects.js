// Object syntax

// Did you see that? The phonebookEntry object handled data (a name and a telephone number) as well as a procedure (the function that printed who it was calling).

// In that example, we gave the key name the value 'Oxnard Montalvo' and the key number the value '(555) 555-5555'. 
// An object is like an array in this way, except its keys can be variables and strings, not just numbers.

// Objects are just collections of information (keys and values) between curly braces, like this:

var myObject = {
    key: value,
    key: value,
    key: value
};


me = {
    name: 'Ernis',
    age: 22
};

var me = new Object();


me['name'] = 'Ernis';
me.age = 22;


myArray = [2, true, 'awf', new Object()];



var myObject = {
  name: 'Eduardo',
  type: 'Most excellent',
  // Add your code here!
  interests: ['Ruby', 'JS', 44]
};
