# The Four Verbs
# The number of HTTP methods you'll use is quite smallâ€”there are just four HTTP "verbs" you'll need to know! They are:

# GET: retrieves information from the specified source.
# POST: sends new information to the specified source.
# PUT: updates existing information of the specified source.
# DELETE: removes existing information from the specified source.
# So when we sent our GET request to placekitten.com, we retrieved information. 
# When you add to or update your blog, you're sending POST or PUT requests; 
# when you delete a tweet, there goes a DELETE request.
