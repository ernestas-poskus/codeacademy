# Anatomy of a Response
# The HTTP response structure mirrors that of the HTTP request. It contains:

# A response line, which includes the three-digit HTTP status code;

# A header, which includes further information about the server and its response;

# The body, which contains the text of the response.


# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8

# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
