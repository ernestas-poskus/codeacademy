# Anatomy of a Request
# An HTTP request is made up of three parts:

# The request line, which tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, etc.) and what resource it's looking for;
# The header, which sends the server additional information (such as which client is making the request)
# The body, which can be empty (as in a GET request) or contain data (if you're POSTing or PUTing information, that information is contained here).

# POST /codecademy/learn-http HTTP/1.1
# Host: www.codecademy.com
# Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
